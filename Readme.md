# Google Foo Bar Challenge
Google offers a coding challenge to those who received an invitation from a friend who also solved/solving foo-bar challenges, or by some weird voodoo rules that google made up. I got in through the second one.

This is a record of my journey through the google foobar. As I progress I will post the problem and their solutions (if I solve them). All solutions I provide here are written in python 2.7.

## Rules

The rules of the challenge are pretty simple.

- One can solve only one problem at a time.
- There is a time restraint in which he/she have to solve the problem. For me it was 7 days for level one to three and 14 days for level 4
- A solution is only accepted for review only if their test case passes. To pass a test case one have to solve them with correct output, and under some time constraint.

These challenges are tough, good mathematical concepts are hidden in these challenges. Try to understand them but don't try to copy the codes. Rest assured google will catch you if you do something like that.
  
## Rewards

Google uses this foobar challenge for their recruiting. But its not a guarantee that they will reach out. They took my details after I completed level 3. And provided me with 2 referral codes to pass on to other fellow coders.

## Note
I currently have 2 links for referral, if you want to take part in the google foo bar mail me or raise an issue, I will assign a task like some imporvement in current code or any other parallel implementation. In case I like your work I will share the link with you.
